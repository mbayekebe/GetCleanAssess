The purpose of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

An R script called run_analysis.R has been created that does the following: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each   activity and each subject. 

A codebook, called CodeBook.Rmd has been created that describes the outputs of all the work performed with the data, the transformations on the different variables. To make it easy for the reader it is in the form of R markdown with the corresponding HTML out put in the file CodeBook.html.
